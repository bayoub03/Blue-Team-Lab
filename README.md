# Blue-Team-Lab

This repository contains the architecture used to create the Blue Team Lab
this was inspired by https://facyber.me/posts/blue-team-lab-guide-part-1/


This is the list of tools used for building the lab:
- VMWare Workstation - you can also use other alternatives like VirtualBox
- draw.io - for creating network topologies and diagrams (Cisco, AWS, Microsoft, Googleâ€¦).
- Notion - Note-taking app, will contain all kinds of notes. Keep track of what is needed, what we already did, information about VMs, services, etc.
- Virtual Machines - some of those will be pfSense, Tsurugi, REMnux, and more.
